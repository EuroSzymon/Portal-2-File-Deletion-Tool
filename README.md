# Portal-2-File-Deletion-Tool

**DO NOT USE OLDER VERSIONS THAN 1.0.4! THESE WILL MOST LIKELY TO NOT WORKING. 1.0.4 IS A VERSION WHICH IS A MINIMUM TO BE A WORKING VERSION BUT IT'S ALSO RECOMMENDED TO INSTALL AVAILABLE NEWER VERSIONS.** And it's only working on Windows at the moment.
A program that deletes the Portal 2 default files. **It doesn't remove custom files though (for example BEE2 or custom portal2_dlc files).** 
New releases (updates) will appear occasionally.
Program created for fixing no-audio bug despite typing snd_rebuildaudiocache command. It also can used as a simple to use audio cache rebuilder. After deleting files make sure you checked the Steam game integrity. **Required Portal 2 to work.** 
**Currently feature requests aren't accepted.**
