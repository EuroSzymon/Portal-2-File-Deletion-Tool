# Portal-2-File-Deletion-Tool
A program that deletes the Portal 2 default files and uses console and system functions. It doesn't remove custom files though (for example BEE2 or custom portal2_dlc files). Program only works on Windows system.

New releases (updates) will appear occasionally.
Program created for and for fixing no-audio bug despite typing snd_rebuildaudiocache command. It also can used as a simple to use audio cache rebuilder. After deleting files you check the Steam game integrity. Required Portal 2 to work. 

In future releases there may be graphical updates. For this moment, it uses only console and system functions.
