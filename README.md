# ABOUT
A program that deletes the Portal 2 default files. **It doesn't remove custom files though (for example BEE2 or custom portal2_dlc files).** 
New releases (updates) will appear occasionally.
Program created for fixing no-audio bug despite typing snd_rebuildaudiocache command. It also can used as a simple to use audio cache rebuilder. After deleting files make sure you checked the Steam game integrity. **Required Portal 2 to work.** 
**Currently feature requests aren't accepted.** 
Note: Using the latest version, when you decide to backup and remove Portal 2 files again - some files may disappear so please use it only once!
