# Portal-2-File-Deletion-Tool
***DO NOT USE OLDER VERSION THAN 1.0.4! THESE ARE HIGHLY LIKELY TO NEVER WORKING.***
A program that deletes the Portal 2 default files. **It doesn't remove custom files though (for example BEE2 or custom portal2_dlc files).** 
New releases (updates) will appear occasionally.
Program created for fixing no-audio bug despite typing snd_rebuildaudiocache command. It also can used as a simple to use audio cache rebuilder. After deleting files make sure you checked the Steam game integrity. **Required Portal 2 to work.** 
**Currently feature requests aren't accepted.**

***~In future releases there may be graphical updates. For this moment, it uses only console and system functions.~*** Released in 1.0.1
